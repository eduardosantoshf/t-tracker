# TQSProject

The objective of this project is to specify and implement a medium-sized project, comprising a multi-layered, enterprise web application and a Software Quality Assurance (SQA) strategy, applied throughout the software engineering process.

The results will include:
* Track I: a viable software product (functional specification, system architecture and implementation).
* Track II: the Software Quality Environment (SQE).

## T-Tracker

Nowadays, people are looking for more and more services. With that in mind, the COVID-19 situation is not different. Is important to keep up technologically. Becausa of that, people would rather test themselves at home and then receive the result without even having to leave home. Besides that, with this service, there will be less direct contact between people and, therefore, less risk associated with it.
